LICENSE TERMS

This is a license agreement between you and Matt Cooper and Joe Hasselstrom 
(referenced here as, Matt & Joe) describing your rights to use the software, 
which has been supplied under the terms of this license.  For your convenience,
we've organized this agreement into two parts. The first part includes 
introductory terms; the Additional Terms and Limited Warranty follow and 
contain greater detail. You should review the entire agreement, including any 
linked terms, because all of the terms are important and together create this 
contract that applies to you.  THE ADDITIONAL TERMS CONTAIN A BINDING 
ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. IF YOU LIVE IN THE UNITED STATES, 
THESE AFFECT YOUR RIGHTS TO RESOLVE A DISPUTE WITH Matt & Joe, AND YOU SHOULD 
READ THEM CAREFULLY.

BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT OR USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO ALL OF THESE 
TERMS AND CONSENT TO ABIDE BY THEM. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT AND COMPLY WITH 
THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT USE THE SOFTWARE OR FEATURES.
 
How can I use the software? We do not sell our software or your copy of it – 
we only license it. Under our license we grant you the right to install and 
run that one copy on one computer (the licensed computer) for use by one 
person at a time, but only if you comply with all the terms of this agreement. 
Our software license is permanently assigned to the licensed computer.  The 
components of the software are licensed as a single unit. You may not separate 
or virtualize the components and install them on different computers. The 
software may include more than one version, such as 32-bit and 64-bit, and you 
may install and use only one version at a time.  This license is for direct use 
of the software only through the input mechanisms of the licensed computer, such 
as a keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen. It does not give permission for 
installation of the software on a server or for use by or through other 
computers or devices connected to the server over an internal or external
 network. The software also is not licensed for commercial hosting.

How do I obtain a backup copy?  You may order or download a backup copy of the 
software from Matt & Joe, at Matt’s and/or Joe’s discretion. If a backup is 
provided, you may not distribute the backup copy of the software. You may use 
it only to reinstall the software on the licensed computer.

Can I transfer the software to another computer or user? You may not transfer 
the software to another computer or user. You may transfer the software directly 
to a third party only as installed on the licensed computer, with this 
agreement. Before the transfer, that party must agree that this agreement 
applies to the transfer and use of the software. You may not retain any copies.

Does the software collect my personal information? No.

What does this agreement apply to? This agreement applies to the software, the 
media on which you received the software, and also any updates from Matt & Joe, 
supplements, and services for the software, unless other terms come with them.

Are there things I'm not allowed to do with the software? Yes. Because the 
software is licensed, not sold, Matt & Joe reserve all rights (such as rights 
under intellectual property laws) not expressly granted in this agreement. In 
particular, this license does not give you any right to, and you may not: use 
or virtualize features of the software separately, publish, copy (other than 
the permitted backup copy), rent, lease, or lend the software; transfer the 
software (except as permitted by this agreement), attempt to circumvent 
technical protection measures in the software, reverse engineer, decompile, or 
disassemble the software, except if the laws where you live permit this even 
when our agreement does not.  In that case, you may do only what your law 
allows. You may not use any features of the software in any way that could 
interfere with anyone else's use of them, or to try to gain access to any 
service, data, account or network, in an unauthorized manner.

What about upgrading or converting the software? If you install the software 
covered by this agreement as an upgrade or conversion to your existing software, 
then the upgrade or conversion replaces the original software that you are 
upgrading or converting from. You do not retain any rights to the original 
software after you have upgraded and you may not continue to use it or transfer 
it in any way. This agreement governs your rights to use the upgrade software 
and replaces the agreement for the software from which you upgraded.

ADDITIONAL TERMS

LICENSE RIGHTS AND MULTI USER SCENARIOS

1.  Computer. In this agreement, "computer" means a hardware system (whether 
physical or virtual) with a storage device capable of running the software.  
A hardware partition or blade is considered to be a computer.

2.  Multiple or pooled connections. You may not use hardware or software to 
multiplex or pool connections, or otherwise allow multiple users or multiple 
computers or devices to access or use the software indirectly through the 
licensed computer.

3.  Use in a virtualized environment. If you use virtualization software, 
including client hyper-v, to create one or more virtual computers on a single 
computer hardware system, each virtual computer, and the physical computer, is 
considered a separate computer for purposes of this agreement. This license 
allows you to install only one copy of the software for use on one computer, 
whether that computer is physical or virtual. If you want to use the software 
on more than one computer, you must obtain separate copies of the software and 
a separate license for each copy. Content protected by digital rights 
management technology or other full-volume disk drive encryption technology may 
be less secure in a virtualized environment.

4.  Remote access. The user that primarily uses the licensed computer is the 
"primary user." The primary user may access and use the software installed on 
the licensed device remotely from any other device, as long as the software 
installed on the licensed device is not being used non-remotely by another user 
simultaneously. As an exception, you may allow others to access the software 
simultaneously only to provide you with technical support.

BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER

1.  Application. This Section applies to any dispute EXCEPT IT DOES NOT INCLUDE 
A DISPUTE RELATING TO THE ENFORCEMENT OR VALIDITY OF YOUR, Matt’s or Joe’s, OR 
EITHER OF OUR LICENSORS' INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. Dispute means any 
dispute, action, or other controversy between you and Matt & Joe concerning the 
software (including its price) or this agreement, whether in contract, warranty, 
tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis. 
"Dispute" will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law.

2.  Notice of Dispute. In the event of a dispute, you or Matt & Joe must give 
the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement of the name, 
address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise 
to the dispute, and the relief requested. You must send any Notice of Dispute 
by U.S. Mail to Matt & Joe, ATTN: ARBITRATION, [address].  Matt & Joe will send 
any Notice of Dispute to you by U.S. Mail to your address if we have it, or 
otherwise to your e-mail address. You and Matt & Joe will attempt to resolve 
any dispute through informal negotiation within 60 days from the date the 
Notice of Dispute is sent. After 60 days, you or Matt & Joe may commence 
arbitration.

3.  Small Claims Court. You may also litigate any dispute in small claims court 
in your county of residence or Bradford County, Pennsylvania, if the dispute 
meets all requirements to be heard in the small claims court. You may litigate 
in small claims court whether or not you negotiated informally first.

4.  BINDING ARBITRATION. IF YOU AND Matt & Joe DO NOT RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BY 
INFORMAL NEGOTIATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, ANY OTHER EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE 
DISPUTE WILL BE CONDUCTED EXCLUSIVELY BY BINDING ARBITRATION.  YOU ARE GIVING 
UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE (OR PARTICIPATE IN AS A PARTY OR CLASS MEMBER) ALL 
DISPUTES IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY. Instead, all disputes will be 
resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a 
limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act. Any court with 
jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator's award.

5.  CLASS ACTION WAIVER. ANY PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN 
ANY FORUM WILL BE CONDUCTED SOLELY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. NEITHER YOU NOR 
Matt & Joe WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS 
OR PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. NO ARBITRATION OR PROCEEDING 
WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES 
TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.

6.  Arbitration Procedure, Costs, Fees and Incentives. Any arbitration will be 
conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") under its 
Commercial Arbitration Rules and in many cases its Supplementary Procedures for 
Consumer-Related Disputes. For more information, see adr.org or call 
1-800-778-7879. Under no circumstances will Matt & Joe reimburse your filing 
fees or pay the AAA's and arbitrator's fees. You agree to the terms governing 
procedures, and to pay any associated fees.  You agree to commence arbitration 
only in your county of residence or in Bradford County, Pennsylvania. Matt & Joe 
agree to commence arbitration only in Bradford County, Pennsylvania.

7.  Claims or Disputes Must be Filed Within One Year. To the extent permitted by 
law, any claim or dispute under this agreement to which this Section applies 
must be filed within one year in small claims court or in arbitration. The 
one-year period begins when the claim or dispute first could be filed. If such a 
claim or dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred.

8.  Severability. If the class action waiver in this Section is found to be 
illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then this Section 
(arbitration) will not apply to those parts. Instead, those parts will be 
severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in 
arbitration. If any other provision of this Section is found to be illegal or 
unenforceable, that provision will be severed with the remainder of this Section 
remaining in full force and effect.

CHOICE OF LAW

The laws of the state or country where you live govern all claims and disputes 
under this agreement, including breach of contact claims and claims under state 
consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, implied warranty laws, for 
unjust enrichment, and in tort. If you acquired the software in any other country, 
the laws of that country apply. This agreement describes certain legal rights. 
You may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your 
state or country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom 
you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if 
the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so.

ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS

1.  Third Party Programs. The software may include third party programs that 
Matt & Joe, not the third party, licenses to you under this agreement. Notices, 
if any, for the third party program are included for your information only.

2.  Trial and Conversion. Some or all of the software may be licensed on a trial 
basis. Your rights to use trial software are limited to the trial period. The 
trial software and length of the trial period are set forth during the 
activation process. You may have the option to convert your trial rights to 
subscription or perpetual rights. Conversion options will be presented to you at 
the expiration of your trial period. After the expiration of any trial period 
without conversion, features of the trial software may stop running. TRIAL 
SOFTWARE IS LICENSED "AS-IS," AND YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. Matt & Joe GIVE 
NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL 
CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. 
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, Matt & Joe EXCLUDE THE IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND 
NON-INFRINGEMENT.

3.  Subscription Software. If you licensed the software on a subscription basis, 
your rights to use the software are limited to the subscription period. You may 
have the option to extend your subscription or convert to a perpetual license. 
If you extend your subscription, you may continue using the software until the 
end of your extended subscription period. See the software activation screens 
or other accompanying materials for subscription details. After the expiration 
of your subscription, most features of the software will stop running.

GEOGRAPHIC AND EXPORT RESTRICTIONS

If there is a geographic region indicated on your software packaging, then you 
may activate the software only in that region. You must also comply with all 
domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the 
software, which include restrictions on destinations, end users, and end use.

SUPPORT AND REFUND PROCEDURES

Matt & Joe provides NO support services for licensed software.

If you are seeking a refund, and you cannot obtain one where you acquired the 
software, contact Matt & Joe for information about Matt's and/or Joe’s refund 
policies.

ENTIRE AGREEMENT

This agreement (together with terms accompanying any software supplements, 
updates, and services that are provided by Matt & Joe and that you use), and the 
terms contained in additional resources noted in this agreement, are the entire 
agreement for the software and any such supplements, updates, and services 
(unless Matt & Joe provide other terms with such supplements, updates, or 
services). You can review this agreement after your software is running by 
consulting this document, and you agree to do so. You agree that for each 
service that is governed by this agreement and also specific terms noted in this 
agreement, you will read the terms for that service before using the service. 
You understand that by using the service, you accept this agreement and the 
noted resource terms. 

RETAIL LIMITED WARRANTY

Do Matt & Joe provide a LIMITED WARRANTY for the software? No, the software is 
licensed "as-is" and without express warranties, guarantees and conditions.  
Matt & Joe do not imply warranty, and do not cover problems that you cause, or 
that arise when you fail to follow our instructions, or that are caused by 
events beyond Matt's and/or Joe’s reasonable control. This applies to any 
supplements, updates, or replacement software that you may receive from 
Matt & Joe.  Matt & Joe EXCLUDE ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THOSE OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. 

What if Matt & Joe breach any part of this agreement? IF YOU HAVE ANY BASIS FOR 
RECOVERING DAMAGES FROM Matt & Joe, YOU CAN RECOVER ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO 
THE AMOUNT THAT YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE. YOU MAY NOT RECOVER ANY OTHER 
DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR INCIDENTAL 
DAMAGES. The damage exclusions and limitations in this agreement apply even if 
repair, replacement or a refund for the software does not fully compensate you 
for any losses or if Matt & Joe knew or should have known about the possibility 
of the damages. SOME STATES AND COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR 
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR OTHER DAMAGES, SO THOSE LIMITATIONS 
OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF YOUR LOCAL LAW ALLOWS YOU TO RECOVER 
OTHER DAMAGES FROM Matt & Joe EVEN THOUGH WE DO NOT, YOU CANNOT RECOVER MORE 
THAN YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE.
